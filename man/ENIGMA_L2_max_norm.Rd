\usage{
ENIGMA_L2_max_norm(
  object,
  alpha = 0.5,
  tao_k = 0.01,
  beta = 0.1,
  epsilon = 0.001,
  max.iter = 1000,
  verbose = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{object}{ENIGMA object}

\item{alpha}{ENIGMA is a multi-objective optimization problem involve two object function, the distance function between observed bulk RNA-seq and reconstitute RNA-seq generated by weighted combination of CSE, and the distance function beween average CSE expression and cell type reference matrix. The alpha is used to determine weights of these two objects. If the alpha gets larger, the optimization attach greater importance on the the first object. Default: 0.5}

\item{tao_k}{The step size of each round of gradient decent. Default: 0.01}

\item{beta}{The regularization parameter to penalize the weight (deconvoluted expression) matrices from being too large. Default: 0.1}

\item{epsilon}{Determine the stop condition in CSE updating. Default: 0.001}

\item{max.iter}{The maximum number of iterations. Default: 1000}

\item{verbose}{Rreturn the information after each step of processing. Default: TRUE}

\item{pos}{Set all entries in CSE is positive. Default: TRUE}

\item{Normalize}{perform normalization on resulted expression profile. Default: TRUE}

\item{Norm.method}{Method used to perform normalization. User could choose PC, frac or quantile}

\item{preprocess}{Method used to perform variance stablization preprocessing. User could choose none, sqrt or log}

\item{loss_his}{save the loss value of each round of iteration.}

\item{model_tracker}{save the model in returned object}

\item{model_name}{name of the model}
}
\value{
ENIGMA object where object@result_CSE contains the inferred CSE profile, object@result_CSE_normalized would contains normalized CSE profile if Normalize = TRUE, object@loss_his would contains the loss values of object functions during model training. If model_tracker = TRUE, then above results would be saved in the object@model.
}
\description{
maximum L2 norm version is the default version of ENIGMA, which is the regularized weighted matrix completion to constraint the maximum L2 norm of inferred cell type-specific gene expression matrix.
