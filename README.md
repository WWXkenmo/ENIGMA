## DEconvolution based on Regularized Matrix Completion algorithm (ENIGMA)
![ENIGMA](https://github.com/WWXkenmo/ENIGMA/blob/master/vignettes/Fig1.png)

## ENIGMA
ENIGMA has three main steps. First, ENIGMA requires cell type reference expression matrix (signature matrix), which could be derived from either FACS RNA-seq or scRNA-seq datasets through calculating the average expression value of each gene from each cell type. Previous researches have widely used reference matrix curated from different platforms, for instance, Newman et al. used LM22 immune signature matrix which
derived from microarray platform to deconvolute bulk RNA-seq dataset. However, we
have to note that use references from different platforms would introduce unwanted batch
effect between reference and bulk RNA-seq matrix, especially for the reference matrix
derived from low coverage scRNA-seq dataset. To overcome this challenge, we used
previously presented method that is specifically designed for correcting batch effect among
bulk RNA-seq matrix and reference matrix. Second, ENIGMA applied robust
linear regression model to estimate each cell type fractions among samples based on
reference matrix derived from the first step. Third, based on reference matrix and cell type
fraction matrix estimated from step 1 and step 2, ENIGMA applied constrained matrix
completion algorithm to deconvolute bulk RNA-seq matrix into CSE on sample-level. In
order to constraint the model complexity to prevent overfitting, we proposed to use two
different norm penalty functions to regularize resulted CSE. Finally, the returned CSE could
be used to identify cell type-specific DEG, visualize each geneâ€™s expression pattern on the
cell type-specific manifold space (e.g. t-SNE, UMAP), and build the cell type-specific
co-expression network to identify modules that relevant to phenotypes of interest
